  Way back in the day there was this man named <span> {{ retrievedPerson.name}}</span>. He had a friend named  <span>{{ retrievedPerson.friend}}</span> that he always was telling me stories about. <span>{{ retrievedPerson.pet}}</span> and I <span>{{ retrievedPerson.adverb}}</span> listened to the stories, but we never gave them a second thought.  One day I ran to the local <span>{{ retrievedPerson.store}}</span> and saw the most awesome <span>{{ retrievedPerson.noun}}</span> I had ever seen. Then, it reminded me of the story the man told me a few years back about how seeing that item meant you would die in 48 hours.  Well, I kind weird and it's been roughly 47 hours... I guess I should <span>{{ retrievedPerson.verb}}</span> now.

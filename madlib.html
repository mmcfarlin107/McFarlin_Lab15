    Way back in the day there was this man named <span class="blue"> {{ retrievedPerson.name}}</span>. He had a friend named <span class="red">{{ retrievedPerson.friend}}</span> that he always was telling me stories about. <span class="orange">{{ retrievedPerson.pet}}</span>    and I <span class="purple">{{ retrievedPerson.adverb}}</span> listened to the stories, but we never gave them a second thought. One day I ran to the local <span class="blue">{{ retrievedPerson.store}}</span> and saw the most awesome <span class="red">{{ retrievedPerson.noun}}</span>    I had ever seen. Then, it reminded me of the story the man told me a few years back about how seeing that item meant you would die in 48 hours. Well, I kind of feel weird and it's been roughly 47 hours... I guess I should go <span class="purple">{{ retrievedPerson.verb}}</span> now.
